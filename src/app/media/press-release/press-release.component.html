      <h3 class="section-sub-heading">About Halo</h3>
      <p class="section-text">HALO is the panacea for consumers and institutions that rely on FDM 3-D printing (a temperature-controlled head extrusion
      of thermoplastic material) but are limited by the capabilities of 3-axis 3-D printing. Designed after several iterations
      to blend into both formal and informal spaces with its seamless lighting and sharp edges, Halo provides an unmarked view
      of the work in progress and a surreal view of the next revolution in the manufacturing industry.</p>
      <p class="section-text">Being the world’s first 5-axis 3D printer and a 5-axis CNC Router, bundled up into one single affordable machine, The Halo
      is poised to become the bulwark of the manufacturing industry and heralds the future. Unleashing of the Halo will result
      in creating futuristic products for the better of mankind and empower the consumer.</p>
